Quick Demo About ASP.NET CORE MVC. Please refer to my PDF file "ASP.NET-MVC-Intro" in the weekly learning for more details and clarifications.

The repo contents is based on:
- [Get started with ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)


# About Project Folders and Files:
This project has: 
- Three controllers, that you can examine them in the following sequence:
    1- HomeController.cs => The default one
    2- HelloWorldController => The custom one for learning as usual "HelloWorld" :-) 
    3- HelloController => The main/final one for running the Web application
- Three Views Folders:
    1- Home => The default one
    2- Shared => That contains the "_Layout.cshtml"
    3- Hello => The new added Folder that contains our main views for the final application

So to run our final application, we browse to:
 > https://localhost:{PORT}/Hello
