# MovieMVC
Quick Demo About ASP.NET CORE MVC. Please refer to my PDF file **"ASP.NET-MVC-Intro"** in the **"Weekly Learning"** for more details and clarifications. All the steps for guiding you through this project is fully documented with images and snapshot in that PDF file.

# About Project Folders and Files:
This project has: 
- Four controllers, that you can examine in the following sequence:
    1- HomeController.cs => The default one
    2- HelloWorldController => The custom one for learning as usual "HelloWorld" :-) 
    3- HelloController => The main temporary one for running the Web application
    3- MoviesController => The final/major one for running the Web application

- Three Views Folders:
    1- Home => The default one
    2- Shared => That contains the "_Layout.cshtml"
    3- Hello => The newly added Folder that contains our main views for the final application

To run the application, we browse to these url based on each topic:
> https://localhost:{PORT}/HelloWorldController

> https://localhost:{PORT}/Hello

> https://localhost:{PORT}/Movies
